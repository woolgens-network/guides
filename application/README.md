# Woolgens Developer Application guide

Hello and welcome to the Woolgens developer application guide! We are happy that you are interested in joining our team. In order to streamline our applications we have decided to create a simple but effective application process. This guide will give you an overview of this process as well as tips on where and how to begin.

# The Application process

The application process will start on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/woolgens). Under the section `Woolgens team` you will find a channel called `apply-for-developer`. Inside of the channel you will find a button which will let you create a new application. The applications should follow this format:

```
Name: YOURNAME
Age: YOURAGE
Github: LINKTOYOURGITHUB
Languages: LISTOFYOURLAMGUAGES
Years of experience: YEARSOFEXPERIENCE

Why do you want to join the team?
SHORT TEXT ABOUT WHY YOU WANT TO JOIN WOOLGENS
```

The application should be very short, as we belive that writing long texts for developer applications is simply _a waste of time_. We will get to know you and your coding style through the coding challenge. We will not make any kind of decison based on your answers in the application. Every developer will be able to complete the coding challenges.

Once we recieve your application a Senior-Developer will answer on the ticket. As long as we belive that the ticket is not meant to troll us we will continue with the application process. 

The Senior-Developer will ask you the complete the [`coding-challenge`](https://github.com/woolgens-network/coding-challenge). This coding challenge will be hosted via Github, which is why we require you to have or create a Github profile. 

The [`coding-challenge`](https://github.com/woolgens-network/coding-challenge) is a Github template repository meaning, that you can clone the repository with the button on the top right of the repository page.

Once you click on `Use as template` you will be promted to clone the repository to your account. Call the repository `woolgens-coding-challenge`. Please commit all of your changes into your repository.

Once you complete the coding challenge please set the repository visability to **Public** ([How to](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility)). Once you have done this notify your Senior-Developer of your completion of the coding challenge in your inital ticket. Please do not forget to send the link to your repository!

The Senior-Developer will then complete a code review. This may take a few days depending on their workload, however we will aim to always finish it within three days. If you have **NOT** recieved an answer after three days, please send a quick message in your ticket and ask for the current status. Do not ask about your status prior, to the three days. 

Once the code review is completed to Senior-Developer may invite you to a "technical interview". This may sound scary, but don't stress ðŸ˜†. This conversation is mainly going to be a "get to know" talk where you will also be able to ask questions about Woolgens and how we develop software. This will also be the last step in the application process. 

Once your technical interview is completed you will get your feedback within a few hours. If all goes well you will then be worked into our team and begin working very soon!
