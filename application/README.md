# Woolgens Developer Application guide

Hello and welcome to the Woolgens developer application guide! We are happy that you are interested in joining our team. In order to streamline our applications we have decided to create a simple but effective application process. This guide will give you an overview of this process as well as tips on where and how to begin.

# The Application process

The application process will start on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/woolgens). Under the section `Woolgens team` you will find a channel called `apply-for-developer`. Inside of the channel you will find a button which will let you create a new application. The applications should follow this format:

```
Name: YOURNAME
Age: YOURAGE
Github: LINKTOYOURGITHUB
Languages: LISTOFYOURLAMGUAGES
Years of experience: YEARSOFEXPERIENCE

Why do you want to join the team?
SHORT TEXT ABOUT WHY YOU WANT TO JOIN WOOLGENS
```

The application should be very short, as we belive that writing long texts for developer applications is simply _a waste of time_. We will get to know you and your coding style through the coding challenge. We will not make any kind of decison based on your answers in the application. Every developer will be able to complete the coding challenges.

Once we recieve your application a Senior-Developer will answer on the ticket. As long as we belive that the ticket is not meant to troll us we will continue with the application process. 

The Senior-Developer will ask you the complete the [`coding-challenge`](https://github.com/woolgens-network/coding-challenge). This coding challenge will be hosted via Github, which is why we require you to have or create a Github profile. 


1. Application on discord -> Ticket gets created
    - Name
    - Age
    - How long have you been programming?
    - What languages do you know?
    - Why do you want to join the team?
3. They revcieve a welcome message from a Senior-Developer with the link to our coding challenge. They will then have three days to complete the coding challenege. 
4. Once they complete their coding challenge they must push it to git and add the account `ReaperMaga`. They will then request a Code review in their Ticket (with the link).
5. Once the senior-developer completes the code review the applicant will recieve some feedback on their code (in github) as well as either an invitation to a technical interview or their application will be denied. 
6. In the technical interview the senior-developer and the applicant will have a short 30 minute talk in which they both get to know each other and bot get to ask some questions. The senior-developer will also ask some questions about the applicants coding expierence and will determine in the call if the applicant is ready to join the developer team. 
7. After the call the senior-developer will announce their decision.
