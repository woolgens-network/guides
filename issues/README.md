# How to create a good issue

### Why?

Issues in area documentation is a very strong feature what Github gives us.
In it it is possible to write down content and divide it into sections and connect them. (example linking: #1)

Among other things, it is possible to describe and manage bugs well.


### Format

#### Sprint

```
** Summary **

** Sprint Sections **
  - [ ] Section task 1 (#1  // link other issues)
  - [ ] Section task 2
```

Example:


```
In this sprint the development environment must be available and the possibility to start directly with the content of the respective project.

Sprint 1:
  - [ ] Create project scaffold (#1)
  - [ ] Add necessary dependencies to pom.xml
  - [ ] ...

```

#### Section
```
** Description **

** Tasks **
  - [ ] Task 1
```

Example:

```
Create project scaffold with the java version 16.

Tasks:
  - [ ] Create quarkus project with the given name "example"
  - [ ] ...

```

### Final words

Try to use the github issue function more often to create TODO lists as an example.

Write down your concepts there as well.
